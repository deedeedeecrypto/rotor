# rotor

Small Sera Virtual Liquidity market maker.

Rotor runs one autonomous command: `rotor mm vl`. On each cadence tick it fetches
the latest source mid for each configured market, builds fixed-bps bid/ask quotes,
cancels the previous tracked quote set when safe, and places the fresh set through
Sera VL where possible. Filled sides tighten the opposite side to `return_bps`
on the next tick.

## Install

```bash
poetry install
```

## Configure

Environment variables are preferred:

```bash
export SERA_BASE_URL="https://api.testnet.sera.cx/api/v1"  # must be https
export SERA_API_KEY="..."
export SERA_API_SECRET="..."
export SERA_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
export WISE_API_TOKEN="..."   # for price_source = wise
export FRED_API_KEY="..."     # for price_source = fed (free FRED API key)
```

`SERA_BASE_URL` must use `https://` (the maker signs orders against it);
`http://` is rejected outside `localhost`.

For file-based local config, copy `.env.example` to the gitignored root `.env`
and fill in real values. `rotor/secret.example.py` remains available only as a
Python fallback template for `rotor/secret.py`. Real environment variables
override `.env`, and `.env` overrides `rotor/secret.py`.

## VL Config

```toml
[[budget]]
token = "USDC"
amount = "5000"

fixed_bps = "50"
return_bps = "1"

[[pair]]
market = "XSGD/USDC"
price_source = "wise"
qty_base = "2000"

[[pair]]
market = "EURC/USDC"
price_source = "ecb"
qty_base = "1000"
fixed_bps = "40"
```

Supported FX sources are `wise`, `ecb`, `fed`, `bnm`, and `mas`. `ecb`, `bnm`,
and `mas` are keyless; `wise` needs `WISE_API_TOKEN` and `fed` (the official
FRED API) needs a free `FRED_API_KEY`. `wise` prices the pair's size through the
Wise quotes API, so its benchmark is the fee-inclusive effective rate for that
amount; the other sources are pure mid rates.

## Run

```bash
poetry run rotor mm vl --config rotor/vl.config.toml --dry-run --once
poetry run rotor mm vl --config rotor/vl.config.toml --poll 305
```

Live mode always cancels reattached configured orders on boot. If Sera's cancel
cooldown is active, Rotor waits 5 minutes and retries before quoting.

Rotor keeps a tiny unresolved-state database at `.rotor_state.sqlite` by
default. It stores only active orders and pending return-side signals, then
prunes rows after cancellation or return-side use. Set `ROTOR_STATE_PATH` to
move it.

Add `--telegram` to send lifecycle/error alerts through the optional Telegram
notifier. Install the extra with `poetry install --extras telegram` when real
Telegram sends are needed; without the extra or token, sends degrade to dry-run
logs.

For autonomous source checkouts, add `--auto-update`. Rotor checks once per day,
runs `git pull --ff-only` only on a clean worktree, stops the current loop after
a successful pull, runs normal shutdown cleanup, and re-execs the same command.

Logs are intentionally small for lightweight servers. The default log level is
`WARNING`; per-tick quote and placement traces require `--log-level DEBUG`.

## Development

```bash
poetry run ruff check rotor tests
poetry run python -m pytest -q
```

Opt-in real Sera testnet checks are skipped by default:

```bash
ROTOR_RUN_TESTNET=1 poetry run python -m pytest -q tests/testnet
```

Opt-in live FX source checks (keyless `ecb`/`bnm`/`mas`; `fed`/`wise` run when
their key is set) are also skipped by default:

```bash
make live-prices   # or: ROTOR_RUN_LIVE_PRICES=1 poetry run python -m pytest -q tests/live
```

The two-wallet maker/taker E2E and the heavier live runner scenarios are
separately gated because they place real testnet orders. See
[tests/testnet/README.md](tests/testnet/README.md).

## Deploy on Manus

To run on [Manus](https://manus.im): register the secrets from
[`.env.manus.example`](.env.manus.example) (exact names) in the Manus secret
store, and schedule the fire-once command (`./scripts/manus_run_once.sh`, i.e.
`rotor mm vl --once`) on a ≥5-minute cadence. Each fire reattaches from Sera,
requotes, and exits without blocking on cancel cooldowns. See
[docs/manus.md](docs/manus.md).

See [docs/vl-mm.md](docs/vl-mm.md) for operator details.
