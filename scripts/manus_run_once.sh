# Fire-once Rotor invocation for a Manus scheduled task.
#
# Manus runs this in the sandbox on its schedule with the secret store injected
# as environment variables. Each run reattaches open orders from Sera, cancels
# the stale set, places a fresh quote set, and exits — so it is safe to fire
# repeatedly. It never blocks on Sera's cancel cooldown.
#
# Set the schedule interval >= Sera's cancel cooldown (~5 min) so each run can
# cancel-and-requote, and keep --order-ttl >= the interval so quotes do not
# expire between runs. Do NOT pass --cancel-on-exit: quotes should rest between
# fires and the next run replaces them.
#
# Exit code 0 = a fresh quote set was placed (or nothing needed placing);
# non-zero = this run could not requote (e.g. cooldown / transient error) and
# the next scheduled fire should retry.
