# Running Rotor on Manus

This guide covers deploying `rotor mm vl` on [Manus](https://manus.im) using its
secret store and scheduled tasks.

## Secrets — exact, no guessing

Manus stores the values you add to its secret store and injects them into the
sandbox as **environment variables under the exact name you register**. Rotor
reads config environment-first (`get_config`: env → `.env` → `rotor/secret.py` →
default), so it consumes them directly.

Register each secret using the **exact** name from
[`.env.manus.example`](../.env.manus.example) — copy the names verbatim. The
required set for a live deployment using the `wise` price source is:

| Secret name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SERA_BASE_URL` | Sera API base (must be `https://`) |
| `SERA_API_KEY` | Sera API key |
| `SERA_API_SECRET` | Sera API secret |
| `SERA_PRIVATE_KEY` | maker signing key (`0x…`) — most sensitive |
| `WISE_API_TOKEN` | Wise quotes API token |
| `ROTOR_STATE_PATH` | (recommended) unresolved-state DB path |

Add `FRED_API_KEY` only if a pair uses `price_source = fed`, and `TELEGRAM_*`
only with `--telegram`.

**If Manus injects under a namespace prefix.** If your stored secrets arrive in
the sandbox as `<PREFIX>SERA_API_KEY` rather than bare `SERA_API_KEY`, set one
variable — `ROTOR_ENV_PREFIX=<PREFIX>` — and rotor resolves every name through
that prefix automatically. Leave it unset when names are injected bare (the
common case).

**Verify in the sandbox** once secrets are set:

```bash
poetry run python -c "from rotor.config import get_config as g; [print(n, 'OK' if g(n) else 'MISSING') for n in ['SERA_BASE_URL','SERA_API_KEY','SERA_API_SECRET','SERA_PRIVATE_KEY','WISE_API_TOKEN']]"
```

## Run mode — scheduled fire-once

Manus sandboxes are oriented around scheduled task sessions rather than a 24/7
foreground daemon, so the robust fit is **fire-once on a schedule**, not a
long-running loop. Each invocation:

1. reattaches open orders for the configured markets from Sera,
2. cancels the stale set (single pass — it never blocks on Sera's cancel
   cooldown in `--once` mode),
3. places a fresh quote set around the latest price,
4. exits (`0` placed/ok, non-zero = could not requote this run — the next fire
   retries).

Because state is recovered from Sera each run, losing the local
`.rotor_state.sqlite` between sandbox sessions is harmless.

### The scheduled command

Point the Manus scheduled task at:

```bash
./scripts/manus_run_once.sh          # = rotor mm vl --config rotor/vl.config.toml --once --order-ttl 600
# or directly:
poetry run rotor mm vl --config rotor/vl.config.toml --once --order-ttl 600
```

The wrapper honors `ROTOR_CONFIG`, `ROTOR_ORDER_TTL`, and `ROTOR_LOG_LEVEL`.

### Cadence guidance

- **Interval ≥ ~5 minutes.** Sera applies a per-order cancel cooldown (~5 min)
  and rotor's local requote guard defaults to 300 s, so firing more often than
  that just yields no-op runs that wait for the cooldown.
- **`--order-ttl` ≥ the interval (plus margin).** Quotes carry a signed
  expiration; with a 5-minute schedule, the default `600` keeps quotes alive
  across a tick (and tolerates one missed fire).
- **Do not pass `--cancel-on-exit`.** Quotes should rest between fires; the next
  run reattaches and replaces them.

## Other notes

- **One instance per wallet.** Rotor takes an advisory lock on
  `<state>.lock`; do not let scheduled runs overlap against the same wallet.
- **Egress.** The sandbox needs outbound HTTPS to Sera and your price source
  (Wise/ECB/BNM/MAS/FRED-API). The legacy FRED scrape endpoint is bot-walled,
  which is why `fed` uses the FRED API.
- **`SERA_BASE_URL` must be `https://`** (rotor refuses a plain-http endpoint
  outside `localhost`).
- **Auto-update.** `--auto-update` is independent of the schedule; leave it off
  unless you specifically want each sandbox to `git pull` before quoting.
