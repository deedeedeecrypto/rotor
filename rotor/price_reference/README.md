# Price Reference

This package turns one named FX source into the benchmark rate used by each pair
in `rotor mm vl`.

Files:

- `__init__.py`: public exports for source adapters, data models, config
  loaders, and symbol mapping helpers.
- `aggregator.py`: freshness-checking `ReferencePriceOracle` wrapper.
- `config.py`: config-driven factory for `wise`, `ecb`, `fed`, `bnm`, and `mas`
  sources plus optional token-to-ISO overrides.
- `models.py`: dataclasses for raw source observations and quote-safe reference
  prices.
- `sources.py`: Wise, ECB, Fed H.10, BNM, and MAS source adapters.
- `symbols.py`: Sera token symbol to ISO currency mapping.

Available sources:

- `wise`: Wise quotes API (`POST /v3/quotes`), priced for the worked amount.
  Needs `WISE_API_TOKEN`. Unlike the reference feeds below, its rate is the
  **fee-inclusive effective rate** (`targetAmount / sourceAmount`) for the
  cheapest enabled payment method, so it moves with the trade size. Pin a method
  with `WISE_PAY_IN`/`WISE_PAY_OUT`; set a fallback size with
  `WISE_DEFAULT_AMOUNT` (used only when a caller omits the amount).
- `ecb`: ECB daily euro reference rates, crossed through EUR. Keyless. Pure mid.
- `fed`: Federal Reserve H.10 rates via the official FRED API
  (`api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations`), crossed through USD. Needs a
  free `FRED_API_KEY` (the legacy `fredgraph.csv` scrape endpoint is fronted by
  Akamai Bot Manager and unreliable from servers).
- `bnm`: Bank Negara Malaysia OpenAPI exchange rates, crossed through MYR. Keyless.
- `mas`: MAS/data.gov.sg exchange rates, crossed through SGD. Keyless. The default
  resource covers USD; add resource ids for more currencies when needed.

Only `wise` and `fed` require a credential; `ecb`, `bnm`, and `mas` are keyless.

## Freshness

Each observation is stamped with the provider's **published** timestamp (Wise's
quote time; the ECB `Cube time`; the FRED/BNM/MAS row date), not fetch time, so a
stale (e.g. weekend or holiday) feed is detectable. `ReferencePriceOracle`
rejects an observation older than the source's window:

- `wise`: 10 minutes (intraday).
- `ecb` / `fed` / `bnm` / `mas`: 48 hours (daily references legitimately carry
  the same rate across a business day plus weekends).

Override one source with `<SOURCE>_MAX_AGE_S` (e.g. `ECB_MAX_AGE_S=259200`), all
of them with `PRICE_REFERENCE_MAX_AGE_S`, or everything at runtime with the
`--max-reference-age` CLI flag.

The bot maps token markets to fiat ISO pairs before pricing:

| Sera market | FX pair |
| --- | --- |
| `XSGD/USDC` | `SGD/USD` |
| `MYRT/USDT` | `MYR/USD` |
| `EURC/USDC` | `EUR/USD` |

Environment config:

```bash
export PRICE_REFERENCE_SOURCE="wise"   # wise, ecb, fed, bnm, or mas
export WISE_API_TOKEN="..."            # required for the wise source
export WISE_PAY_IN="BALANCE"           # optional: pin Wise payment method
export FRED_API_KEY="..."              # required for the fed source
export FED_H10_SERIES_JSON='{"EUR":"DEXUSEU","MYR":"DEXMAUS","SGD":"DEXSIUS"}'
export MAS_EXCHANGE_RATE_RESOURCE_IDS_JSON='{"USD":"d_046ff8d521a218d9178178cfbfc45c2c"}'
export ECB_MAX_AGE_S="172800"          # optional per-source staleness override
```

The same `KEY=VALUE` lines can be placed in a root `.env`. Optional local
`rotor/secret.py` config remains a Python fallback:

```python
PRICE_REFERENCE_SOURCE = "wise"
WISE_API_TOKEN = "..."
WISE_BASE_URL = "https://api.wise.com"
ECB_RATES_URL = "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml"
FRED_API_KEY = "..."  # free key: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
FRED_API_BASE_URL = "https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations"
FED_H10_SERIES_JSON = {"EUR": "DEXUSEU", "MYR": "DEXMAUS", "SGD": "DEXSIUS"}
BNM_EXCHANGE_RATE_BASE_URL = "https://api.bnm.gov.my/public/exchange-rate"
MAS_EXCHANGE_RATE_URL = "https://data.gov.sg/api/action/datastore_search"
MAS_EXCHANGE_RATE_RESOURCE_IDS_JSON = {
    "USD": "d_046ff8d521a218d9178178cfbfc45c2c",
}
```

ECB, Fed H.10, BNM, and MAS are official/reference sources. They are useful as
transparent fallbacks or regional official feeds, but they are not live tick
sources in the same way Wise can be. `fed` uses the official FRED API and needs
a free `FRED_API_KEY`; ECB, BNM, and MAS are keyless.
