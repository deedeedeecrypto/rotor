"""EIP-712 type definitions + uuid_int bit packing for Sera orders.

Pure helpers: no network I/O, no key material. The order/cancel structs
should match Sera's on-chain `ORDER_TYPEHASH`; `uuid_int` should match
the composite encoding the server enforces.

Domain separator note:
    This module does NOT compute or hold the EIP-712 domain separator.
    The domain dict (chainId, verifyingContract, name, version) is
    fetched from Sera's `GET /config` by `SeraClient.bootstrap()` and
    passed to the injected signer at sign time. The signer
    (`rotor.security.key.sign_typed_data`) is the one that computes
    `keccak256("EIP712Domain(...)")` and the message digest. See the
    audit notes — if the live `/config` returns a domain whose
    `verifyingContract` differs from the on-chain ORDER_TYPEHASH
    consumer, signatures will silently mis-verify.

Signature serialization:
    By convention `eth_account` returns ``r ‖ s ‖ v`` as 65 bytes,
    serialized as ``0x``-prefixed hex (132 chars). The signer adjusts
    `v` to either ``{27, 28}`` (legacy) or ``{0, 1}`` depending on the
    underlying library; verify the consumer of this signature on the
    Sera side accepts the produced encoding (some on-chain validators
    require `v ∈ {27, 28}` while EIP-2098 packs it into the high bit
    of `s`).
